# Damage Meter
You've been working with some interns to build a damage meter for Fantasy Quest. They've added some calls to the `main` function that contain invalid syntax.

## Assignment
Fix the intern's syntax error. The `calculate_dps` function takes two inputs, but due to the syntax error, it's taking in 4 instead. Use the proper delimiter so that the numbers are still easy to parse visually.

The two input numbers should be:

- damage: 8 million, time: 45
- damage: 10 million, time: 49
