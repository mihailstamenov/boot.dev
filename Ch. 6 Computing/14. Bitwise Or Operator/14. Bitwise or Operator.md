# Bitwise `|` Operator

As you may have guessed, the bitwise "or" operator is similar to the bitwise "and" operator in that it works on binary rather than boolean values. However, the bitwise "or" operator "or"s the bits together. Here's an example:

```
0101 is 5
0111 is 7
0101
|
0111
=
0111
```
A `1` in binary is the same as `True`, while `0` is `False`. So a bitwise operation is just a bunch of logical operations that are completed in tandem. When two binary numbers are "or"ed together, the result has a 1 in any place where either of the input numbers has a 1 in that place.

`|` is the bitwise "or" operator in Python. `5 | 7 = 7` and `5 | 2 = 7` as well!

- `0101` is 5
- `0010` is 2
```
0101
|
0010
=
0111
```
## Guild Permissions
A "guild" is a team of 2-4 players. Here are the guild-specific permissions:

- `can_invite` - Leftmost bit (`0b1000`)
- `can_kick` - Second to leftmost bit (`0b0100`)
- `can_enter_dungeon` - Second to rightmost bit (`0b0010`)
- `can_surrender` - Rightmost bit (`0b0001`)
When players are in a guild together, they gain *all* the permissions of *all* the other members of the guild!

For example, if:

- Jack has the `can_invite` permission: `0b1000`
- Jill has the `can_kick` permission: `0b0100`

Then, when they are partied together, they should both have the `can_invite` and `can_kick` permissions: `0b1100`.

## Assignment
Complete the `calculate_guild_perms` function. It should return a binary number that represents the permissions of *all* the members of the guild (Glorfindel, Galadriel, Elendil and Elrond).

Use a series of bitwise "or" operations to calculate the superset of all the member's permissions.
