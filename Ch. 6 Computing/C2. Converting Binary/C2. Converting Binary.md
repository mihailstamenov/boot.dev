# Converting Binary

Fantasy Quest needs to <u>migrate</u> old data. Some of their legacy systems stored data as three binary strings which need to be converted to integers.

The built-in <u>int</u> function can convert a binary string to an integer. It takes a second argument that specifies the base of the number (binary is base 2). 

For example:
```python
# this is a binary string
binary_string = "100"

# convert binary string to integer
num = int(binary_string, 2)
```
## Assignment
Complete the `binary_string_to_int` function. It takes three binary strings as input and returns each of them in the same order as integers. Each integer is the numerical value of the string when interpreted as binary.

For example:
```python
data_a, data_b, data_c = binary_string_to_int("100", "101", "110")
print(data_a)
# 4
print(data_b)
# 5
print(data_c)
# 6
```
