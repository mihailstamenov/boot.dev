# In the code sample, what will happen?

try:
    10/0
except Exception as e:
    print("other")

# other

# In this code, the `try` block contains an operation that attempts to divide 10 by 0. Normally, dividing by zero in Python raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.

# The `except` block is set to catch any exception of type `Exception`, which is the base class for most built-in exceptions, including `ZeroDivisionError`. The variable `e` is used to hold the exception object, though it isn't used here.

# When the division by zero is attempted in the try block, a ZeroDivisionError is raised. Since ZeroDivisionError is a subclass of Exception, the except block matches the error type, and the code inside the block executes, printing "other" to the console.

# Given this, the correct multiple choice answer is "It will print 'other'".

# What are your thoughts on how exceptions work in this code?
