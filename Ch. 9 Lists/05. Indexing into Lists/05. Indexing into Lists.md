# Indexing into Lists

Now that we know how to create new lists, we need to know how to access specific items in the list.

We access items in a list directly by using their *index*. Indexes start at 0 (the first item) and increment by one with each successive item. The syntax is as follows:
```python
best_languages = ["JavaScript", "Go", "Rust", "Python", "C"]
print(best_languages[1])
# prints "Go", because index 1 was provided
```

## Assignment

We need to allow our players to access items in their inventories!

Fix our `get_leather_scraps` function by changing the value of `item_index` to the index in `inventory` that holds the value "Leather Scraps".
