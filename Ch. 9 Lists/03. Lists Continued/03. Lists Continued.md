# Counting in Programming

In the world of programming, counting is a bit strange!

We don't start counting at `1`, we start at `0` instead.

## Indexes

Each item in a list has an index that refers to its spot in the list.

Take the following list as an example:
```python
names = ["Bob", "Lane", "Alice", "Breanna"]
```

- Index 0: `Bob`
- Index 1: `Lane`
- Index 2: `Alice`
- Index 3: `Breanna`
