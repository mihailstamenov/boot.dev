# Lists Continued

Sometimes when we're manually creating lists it can be hard to read if all the items are on the same line of code. We can declare the list using multiple lines if we want to:

```python
flower_types = [
    "daffodil",
    "rose",
    "chrysanthemum"
]

player_ages = [
    23,
    18,
    31,
    42
]
```
Keep in mind this is just a styling change. The code will run correctly either way.
